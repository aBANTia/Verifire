# Verifire
A location-based natural disaster notifier.

Due to the increase in wildfires in California, and their realtive proximity to urban areas, we built a real-time web application to notify people of dangers. The original goal was to show news and video information, but we were able to display fire locations with heat indexes, incorporate a real-time chat, and provide alerts from LAFD.
